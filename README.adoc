=== Automate
Automate domain contains enhancements for IT Process automation, lifecycle provisioning,
integrations with providers that Red Hat ManageIQ currently supports i.e.
EC2, vCenter, RHEV, oVirt, Satellite, OpenStack, Lenovo Xclarity, etc...

IMPORTANT: 3rd party integrations will be included in a separate repo in the near future.

Follow these steps to install the ManageIQ_Essentials Automate Domain:

. Open the "automate" folder (e.g. cd /tmp/ManageIQ_Essentials-master/automate/)
. Compress/zip the `automate/ManageIQ_Essentials` directory (e.g. `zip -r ManageIQ_Essentials_Automate_Domain.zip ManageIQ_Essentials/`)
. Log into your ManageIQ/ManageIQ UI as an administrator
. Navigate to the Automate -> Import / Export screen
. Upload the zip file. This can take 60-90 seconds.
. Select the namespaces you wish to import (e.g. select all) and click the Commit button.
. When done, navigate to the Automate -> Explorer screen
. You will need to edit the new ManageIQ_Essentials domain and check the "enable" box.
. The ManageIQ_Essentials automate domain is ready to use!.

TIP: The ManageIQ_Essentials automate model is locked by default. To modify something simply create
     a new domain and copy the method, class, etc... to the new domain. This preserves the domain and makes
     it easy to see what changes were made. Great for PRs!
